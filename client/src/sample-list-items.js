    text: 'My name is Mariana and I’m a Brazilian teacher, currently living in England. I graduated in Languages and Literature in Brazil and I’ve been teaching for about 5 years now. I’m a native Brazilian Portuguese speaker and fluent in English (level C1 according to the European Framework, which means advanced English). Nowadays, speaking a foreign language is essential for those who are at universities, looking for new jobs or for those who just want to travel the world. So, I usually design my classes according to each student\'s needs, which makes the whole learning process easier. I also try to create a dynamic and enjoyable environment, using multiple learning strategies when required. Teaching is my passion and there\'s nothing more rewarding than seeing my students improving their language skills. Meu nome é Mariana e sou uma professora brasileira, atualmente morando na Inglaterra. Me formei em Letras - Inglês/Literaturas no Brasil e venho atuando como professora há cerca de 5 anos. Sou nativa em Português e fluente em Inglês (nível C1 de acordo com o European Framework, o que indica nível avançado de Inglês). Hoje em dia, falar uma língua estrangeira é fundamental para aqueles que estão na faculdade, procurando por um novo emprego e para aqueles que apenas querem viajar pelo mundo. Então, eu costumo criar minhas aulas de acordo com a necessidade de cada aluno, o que torna todo o processo de aprendizagem mais fácil. Eu também tento criar um ambiente dinâmico e agradável, usando diversas estratégias de aprendizagem, quando necessário. Ensinar é minha paixão e não há nada mais gratificante do que ver meus alunos desenvolvendo suas habilidades linguísticas.'
